##Important
This idea is just a part of a project that could be implemented in the future!
The main goal is to demonstrate principles of design following several activities and create a prototype for demonstration on faculty as a part of the subject of Human-computer interaction.

##Idea
Researching the needs of farmers, the goal of this project is the implementation of a web application that will contribute to the easier sale of domestic products.

##Process
  1. Interviewing potential users and using notes for the purpose of upcoming tasks.
  2. Making PMF matrix
  3. Creating Use case diagram
  4. Hierarchical task analysis through HTA diagram
  5. Prototyping through Mockups.com

##Additional info
This was my first time working on analysis and prototyping :)
Learning about User experience and User interface was interesting.
To conclude, my biggest lesson was: "DOCUMENTATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS 'mini project'".
